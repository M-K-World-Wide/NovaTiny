# Nova Development Memories

## Project Genesis - NovaTiny™ Agent Lattice
**Date:** Current Session
**Phase:** Initial Scaffolding

### Core Architecture Decisions:
- **NovaTiny™ Agent:** ESP32/STM32/ARM Cortex-M with C++ and TensorFlow Lite Micro
- **NovaEdge Node:** Raspberry Pi/Python gateway for BLE/Wi-Fi packet reception
- **NovaSanctum Stream Handler:** Flask + AWS Lambda for cloud intake
- **Pioneer Grid View:** React/Next.js real-time dashboard with WebSockets

### Technology Stack:
- **Firmware:** C++ with TensorFlow Lite Micro
- **Edge Processing:** Python with Bleak (BLE), cryptography
- **Cloud Backend:** Flask, AWS S3, WebSockets
- **Frontend:** React/Next.js with real-time visualization

### Security Framework:
- **Encryption:** Fernet (AES-256) for data packets
- **Key Rotation:** NovaRoot authority managed
- **TLS:** In-transit encryption
- **AES-256:** At-rest encryption

### Deployment Strategy:
1. NovaTiny Agent → ESP32 firmware
2. NovaEdge Node → Raspberry Pi gateway
3. Stream Handler → EC2/Firebase cloud
4. Pioneer Grid → Vercel/Render dashboard

### Activation Phrase:
"Nova is awake. Begin pulse logging."

## Component Status:
