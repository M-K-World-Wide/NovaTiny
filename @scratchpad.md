# Nova Development Scratchpad

## Current Session Tasks:
1. ✅ Initialize documentation structure (@memories.md, @lessons-learned.md, @scratchpad.md)
2. ✅ Scaffold NovaTiny™ Agent Core (main.cpp)
3. ✅ Create NovaSensors Class
4. ✅ Create NovaML Class
5. ✅ Create NovaComms Class
6. ✅ Build NovaEdge Node Gateway
7. ✅ Deploy NovaSanctum Stream Handler
8. ✅ Create Pioneer Grid Dashboard

## Completed Components:
- **NovaTiny Firmware**: Complete C++ implementation with sensor management, TensorFlow Lite Micro integration, and secure BLE/Wi-Fi communication
- **NovaEdge Node**: Python gateway with BLE discovery, Fernet encryption, and cloud forwarding
- **NovaSanctum Stream Handler**: Flask-based cloud API with WebSocket streaming, AWS S3/DynamoDB integration
- **Pioneer Grid Dashboard**: React/Next.js real-time dashboard with emotion visualization and alert system

## Immediate Next Steps:
- Create firmware directory structure
- Implement BLE packet structure
- Set up development environment for ESP32
- Configure TensorFlow Lite Micro integration

## Technical Notes:
- Need to research ESP32 BLE advertising packet limits
- Consider implementing OTA updates from the start
- Plan for model versioning and updates
- Design fail-safe mechanisms for network connectivity

## Questions to Resolve:
- Optimal sensor sampling frequency for emotion detection
- BLE packet size limitations and fragmentation strategy
- Cloud storage retention policies
- Real-time processing latency requirements
