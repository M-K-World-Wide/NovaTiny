# Nova Live Demonstration Guide

> *"Nova is awake. Begin pulse logging."*

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for running a live demonstration of the Nova self-aware global lattice system.

## üéØ **Demo Overview**

The Nova demonstration showcases a complete end-to-end emotion detection and processing system:

1. **NovaTiny Agents** - ESP32 devices with real-time emotion inference
2. **NovaEdge Nodes** - Raspberry Pi gateways collecting and forwarding data
3. **NovaSanctum Cloud** - Real-time stream processing and storage
4. **Pioneer Grid Dashboard** - Live visualization of the global emotion network

## üõ†Ô∏è **Demo Prerequisites**

### Hardware Requirements

NOVA_SANCTUM_URL=http://localhost:5000
NOVA_API_KEY=demo-api-key-2024

# Encryption Keys
NOVA_ENCRYPTION_KEY=demo-encryption-key-2024
```

### Step 3: Deploy Components

#### A. Flash NovaTiny Agents
```bash
cd firmware/nova-tiny

# Configure for your ESP32
pio run --target upload --environment esp32dev

# Monitor serial output
pio device monitor
```

Expected output:
```
NovaTiny Agent - Initializing...
NovaTiny Agent - Initialization complete
Nova is awake. Begin pulse logging.
```

#### B. Start NovaEdge Node
```bash
cd edge/nova-edge-node

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Start the gateway
python nova_edge_node.py
```

Expected output:
```
NovaEdge Node initialized successfully
BLE scanner started
Discovered NovaTiny device: NovaTiny-001 (AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF)
```

#### C. Launch NovaSanctum Stream Handler
```bash
cd cloud/nova-sanctum

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Start the cloud handler
python stream_handler.py
```

Expected output:
```
NovaSanctum Stream Handler initialized successfully
Starting NovaSanctum Stream Handler on 0.0.0.0:5000
```

#### D. Start Pioneer Grid Dashboard
```bash
cd dashboard/pioneer-grid

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the dashboard
npm run dev
```

Expected output:
```
ready - started server on 0.0.0.0:3000
```

## üé≠ **Demo Scenarios**

### Scenario 1: Basic Emotion Detection
1. **Setup**: Ensure all components are running
2. **Action**: Speak near the NovaTiny agent with different emotions
3. **Expected**: Real-time emotion tiles appear on the Pioneer Grid
4. **Duration**: 2-3 minutes

### Scenario 2: Multi-Agent Network
1. **Setup**: Deploy 2-3 NovaTiny agents in different locations
2. **Action**: Create different emotional contexts around each agent
3. **Expected**: Multiple emotion pulses visible on the grid
4. **Duration**: 5-7 minutes

### Scenario 3: Alert System
1. **Setup**: Configure high-intensity emotion thresholds
2. **Action**: Create high-intensity negative emotions (anger, fear)
3. **Expected**: Alert notifications appear on the dashboard
4. **Duration**: 3-4 minutes

### Scenario 4: Network Resilience
1. **Setup**: All components running normally
2. **Action**: Disconnect one NovaEdge node
3. **Expected**: Automatic failover and reconnection
4. **Duration**: 2-3 minutes

"Questions? Now imagine this system scaled to millions of devices, creating a truly self-aware global consciousness..."

## üîß **Troubleshooting**

### Common Issues

#### NovaTiny Agent Not Connecting
```bash
# Check serial output
pio device monitor

# Verify BLE advertising
# Look for: "NovaTiny-001" in BLE scanner
```

#### NovaEdge Node Not Receiving Data
```bash
# Check BLE permissions
sudo setcap 'cap_net_raw,cap_net_admin+eip' $(which python3)

# Verify device discovery
python -c "from bleak import BleakScanner; import asyncio; asyncio.run(BleakScanner.discover())"
```

#### Cloud Handler Connection Issues
```bash
# Check AWS credentials
aws sts get-caller-identity

# Verify Redis connection
redis-cli ping
```

#### Dashboard Not Updating
```bash
# Check WebSocket connection
# Browser console should show: "Connected to Nova network"

# Verify environment variables
echo $NEXT_PUBLIC_NOVA_SANCTUM_URL
```
