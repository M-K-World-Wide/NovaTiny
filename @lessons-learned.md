# Nova Development Lessons Learned

## Firmware Development Insights
- **ESP32 Considerations:** Deep sleep modes critical for battery life
- **TensorFlow Lite Micro:** Model quantization essential for memory constraints
- **BLE vs Wi-Fi:** BLE preferred for low-power, Wi-Fi for high-bandwidth scenarios

## Edge Computing Patterns
- **Gateway Architecture:** Raspberry Pi ideal for local processing before cloud
- **Packet Encryption:** Fernet provides symmetric encryption with key rotation
- **Error Handling:** Graceful degradation when cloud connectivity fails

## Cloud Architecture Best Practices
- **Stream Processing:** Real-time ingestion with S3 backup
- **Scalability:** Lambda functions for burst processing
- **Security:** TLS everywhere, encrypted storage

## Real-Time Dashboard Considerations
- **WebSocket Management:** Connection pooling and reconnection logic
- **Data Visualization:** Emotion intensity mapping and temporal patterns
- **Alert Systems:** Configurable thresholds for different emotion states

## Deployment Lessons
- **Firmware Updates:** OTA (Over-The-Air) update capability essential
- **Monitoring:** Health checks for all lattice components
- **Backup Strategies:** Redundant data paths and failover mechanisms
